## Welcome to our tutorial on smart chemical robots

We believe principles from developmental robotics can benefit when designing curious robotic assistants for lab environments. In this tutorial, we will introduce and showcase examples from robotic assistants at work in our chemistry lab and how they help us characterize our chemical systems more effectively.

Our robots are able to perform physical or chemical experiments with the aim to explore the states a complex system can exhibit, a challenge alike sensory-motor exploration in humans and robots. The tutorial will be of special interest for researchers interested in sensory-motor exploration and its application outside of robotics and developmental sciences.

Our aim is to highlight the potential benefits of interdisciplinary work at the interface of physics, chemistry, robotics and AI.

The work presented is undergone by the Chemobot team within the [Cronin Group](http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/), in the School of Chemistry at the University of Glasgow.

The tutorial is organized by:

- [Jonathan Grizou](http://jgrizou.com/), team leader of the Chemobot team (4 PostDocs, 3 PhD students, 1 Intern), background in Develepmental Robotics.
- Laurie Points, PhD student in the Chemobot team, background in Chemistry.
- Lee Cronin, Professor and head of the [Cronin Group](http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/), his group is pioneering research at the intersection of Chemistry, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.
