## Welcome to our tutorial on smart chemical robots

We believe principles from developmental robotics can help when designing curious robotic assistants for lab environments. In this tutorial, we will introduce and showcase examples from robotic assistants at work in our chemistry lab and how they help us characterize our chemical systems more effectively.

Our robots are able to perform physical or chemical experiments with the aim to explore the states a complex system can exhibit, a challenge alike sensory-motor exploration in humans and robots. The tutorial will be of special interest for researchers interested in sensory-motor exploration and its application outside of robotics and developmental sciences.

Our aim is to highlight the potential benefits of interdisciplinary work at the interface of physics, chemistry, robotics and AI.
