## Welcome to our titorial on chemical robots

The study of complex systems in the real world (e.g. reaction-diffusion systems, self-propelled droplets) is mostly guided by phenomenological observations made by curious scientists. But should we wait until luck, time or serendipity produce such phenomena before our eyes? Or can we actively design tools whose aim is to discover interesting phenomenon for us to later analyze? 

We believe principles from developmental robotics can help when designing curious robotic assistants for lab environments. Such robots would be able to perform physical or chemical experiments with the aim to explore the states a complex system can exhibit, a challenge alike sensory-motor exploration in humans and robots. 

We will introduce this innovative application field and showcase examples from robotic assistants at work in our chemistry lab and how they help us characterize our chemical systems more effectively. Our aim is to highlight the potential benefits of interdisciplinary work at the interface of physics, chemistry, robotics and AI.

The tutorial will be of special interest for researchers interested in sensory-motor exploration and its application outside of robotics and developmental sciences.
